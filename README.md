# REPLKIT

REPLKIT is a Rust port of [go-prompt](https://github.com/c-bata/go-prompt), which was inspired by [python-prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit), with multi-language bindings (Go, Python, Node.js).

Note: To avoid confusion with prompt engineering for LLMs, we chose to use the term REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) instead of “prompt”.
