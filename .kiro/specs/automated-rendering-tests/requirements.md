# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current renderer implementation in `crates/replkit/src/renderer.rs` has persistent bugs that are difficult to debug and fix manually. This feature will implement an automated testing framework for terminal rendering that captures and validates escape sequences, cursor movements, and visual output. This will enable confident refactoring and prevent regressions in the rendering system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the renderer, I want automated tests that capture terminal output using a test-specific ConsoleOutput implementation, so that I can verify rendering behavior without manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rendering operation is performed THEN the system SHALL use a `TestConsoleOutput` that captures all method calls and parameters
2. WHEN escape sequences are captured THEN the system SHALL record them as structured events (MoveCursor, SetStyle, WriteText, Clear, etc.)
3. WHEN rendering tests run THEN the system SHALL validate the sequence of operations against expected patterns
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear diff output showing expected vs actual operation sequences
5. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the system SHALL work with the current `ConsoleOutput` trait without requiring changes to renderer logic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test complex rendering scenarios like completion menus and cursor positioning, so that I can ensure the renderer works correctly in all cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing prompt rendering THEN the system SHALL validate prefix styling, text content, and cursor position
2. WHEN testing completion rendering THEN the system SHALL validate suggestion layout, selection highlighting, and scrolling behavior
3. WHEN testing multi-line scenarios THEN the system SHALL validate line wrapping and cursor movement across lines
4. WHEN testing terminal resize THEN the system SHALL validate that rendering adapts correctly to new dimensions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a mock terminal that simulates real terminal behavior using termwiz terminal emulation, so that tests can run consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the mock terminal THEN it SHALL use the `termwiz` crate to provide full terminal emulation capabilities
2. WHEN escape sequences are sent THEN the mock terminal SHALL process them through termwiz's terminal emulator and update screen state
3. WHEN querying terminal state THEN the mock terminal SHALL return current cursor position, active colors, and screen content using termwiz's screen buffer
4. WHEN terminal operations are performed THEN the mock terminal SHALL leverage termwiz's validation and state management
5. WHEN clearing operations occur THEN the mock terminal SHALL properly handle all clear types through termwiz's terminal implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want snapshot testing for rendering output, so that I can easily detect when rendering behavior changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running snapshot tests THEN the system SHALL save expected rendering output to files
2. WHEN rendering output changes THEN the system SHALL detect differences and prompt for review
3. WHEN snapshots are approved THEN the system SHALL update the expected output files
4. WHEN reviewing snapshots THEN the system SHALL show visual diffs of terminal output

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage existing Rust testing ecosystem tools, so that the testing framework integrates well with standard development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the testing framework THEN it SHALL use standard Rust testing tools (`cargo test`, `assert_eq!`, etc.)
2. WHEN capturing output THEN it SHALL optionally integrate with snapshot testing crates like `insta` for easy approval workflows
3. WHEN parsing escape sequences THEN it SHALL use the `termwiz` crate for terminal emulation and escape sequence processing
4. WHEN running benchmarks THEN it SHALL use `criterion` crate for statistical analysis and regression detection
5. WHEN debugging test failures THEN it SHALL provide integration with standard Rust debugging tools and IDE support
#
## Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automated testing framework to validate compatibility with go-prompt rendering behavior, so that I can ensure replkit produces the same visual output as the proven reference implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing rendering output THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to compare replkit output with go-prompt reference behavior
2. WHEN implementing renderer fixes THEN the system SHALL validate that changes move closer to go-prompt implementation, which is located under ./references/go-prompt.
3. WHEN running compatibility tests THEN the system SHALL test key scenarios: basic prompts, completion menus, cursor positioning, and line wrapping
4. WHEN go-prompt behavior is captured THEN the system SHALL store reference outputs for regression testing
