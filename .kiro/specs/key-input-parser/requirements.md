# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a cross-language key input parser that can handle raw terminal input and convert byte sequences to structured key events. The parser will be implemented in Rust as the core engine, with bindings for Go and Python. It includes a state machine to handle partial byte sequences correctly, similar to prompt_toolkit's VT100 parser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Rust core library, I want to parse raw terminal input bytes into structured key events, so that I can handle keyboard input in my terminal applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw bytes are fed to the parser THEN the system SHALL identify complete key sequences and emit corresponding key events
2. WHEN partial byte sequences are received THEN the system SHALL maintain state until complete sequences arrive
3. WHEN invalid or unknown sequences are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN control characters (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, etc.) are input THEN the system SHALL correctly identify them
5. WHEN escape sequences (arrow keys, function keys) are input THEN the system SHALL parse them correctly
6. WHEN special sequences (mouse events, CPR responses) are detected THEN the system SHALL identify them appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want to use the key parser through Go bindings, so that I can integrate terminal input handling into my Go applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Go binding is imported THEN it SHALL provide a native Go API for key parsing
2. WHEN bytes are fed through the Go API THEN it SHALL return Go-native key structures
3. WHEN the parser state needs to be reset THEN the Go API SHALL provide a reset method
4. WHEN errors occur in parsing THEN the Go API SHALL handle them according to Go conventions
5. WHEN the Go application terminates THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to use the key parser through Python bindings, so that I can integrate terminal input handling into my Python applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python binding is imported THEN it SHALL provide a Pythonic API for key parsing
2. WHEN bytes are fed through the Python API THEN it SHALL return Python-native key objects
3. WHEN the parser state needs to be reset THEN the Python API SHALL provide a reset method
4. WHEN errors occur in parsing THEN the Python API SHALL raise appropriate Python exceptions
5. WHEN callback functions are registered THEN they SHALL be called with parsed key events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer testing the implementation, I want working examples in each language, so that I can understand how to use the parser and verify it works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Rust example is run THEN it SHALL demonstrate raw terminal input parsing with key event output
2. WHEN a Go example is run THEN it SHALL demonstrate the Go binding usage with proper key handling
3. WHEN a Python example is run THEN it SHALL demonstrate the Python binding usage with callback-based parsing
4. WHEN any example receives Ctrl+C THEN it SHALL terminate gracefully
5. WHEN examples receive various key inputs THEN they SHALL display the parsed key information correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the parser, I want comprehensive key type definitions, so that I can handle all common terminal input scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN control keys are defined THEN they SHALL include all standard control characters (Ctrl+A through Ctrl+Z)
2. WHEN navigation keys are defined THEN they SHALL include arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up/Down
3. WHEN function keys are defined THEN they SHALL include F1 through F24
4. WHEN special keys are defined THEN they SHALL include Tab, Enter, Escape, Backspace, Delete
5. WHEN modifier combinations are defined THEN they SHALL include Shift+Arrow keys and other common combinations
6. WHEN special sequences are defined THEN they SHALL include mouse events and CPR responses
