# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a basic REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that integrates the existing ConsoleInput, KeyParser, Buffer, and ConsoleOutput components to provide a working interactive prompt system for both Rust and Go. The REPL will serve as the foundation for building more advanced prompt applications and will demonstrate that all individual components can work together effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core REPL Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic REPL engine that can read user input, process key events, manage text editing, and display output, so that I can build interactive command-line applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the REPL starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all required components (ConsoleInput, ConsoleOutput, KeyParser, Buffer)
2. WHEN the REPL is running THEN the system SHALL display a configurable prompt prefix
3. WHEN the user types characters THEN the system SHALL update the text buffer and refresh the display
4. WHEN the user presses Enter THEN the system SHALL execute the provided callback function with the current input
5. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+C THEN the system SHALL clear the current input and start a new line
6. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+D on empty input THEN the system SHALL exit the REPL gracefully

### Requirement 2: Text Editing Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic text editing capabilities including cursor movement, character insertion/deletion, and line editing, so that I can efficiently compose and edit my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types printable characters THEN the system SHALL insert them at the cursor position and move the cursor forward
2. WHEN the user presses Backspace THEN the system SHALL delete the character before the cursor
3. WHEN the user presses Delete THEN the system SHALL delete the character at the cursor position
4. WHEN the user presses arrow keys THEN the system SHALL move the cursor in the corresponding direction
5. WHEN the user presses Home/End THEN the system SHALL move the cursor to the beginning/end of the line
6. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+A/Ctrl+E THEN the system SHALL move the cursor to the beginning/end of the line

### Requirement 3: Display and Rendering

**User Story:** As a user, I want the REPL to properly display my input with the cursor position visible and handle terminal resizing, so that I have a clear visual representation of my current input state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the REPL displays output THEN the system SHALL show the prompt prefix followed by the current input text
2. WHEN the cursor position changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual cursor position on screen
3. WHEN the terminal window is resized THEN the system SHALL adjust the display accordingly
4. WHEN text is longer than the terminal width THEN the system SHALL handle line wrapping correctly
5. WHEN the display needs updating THEN the system SHALL minimize screen flicker and unnecessary redraws
6. WHEN the REPL exits THEN the system SHALL restore the terminal to its original state

### Requirement 4: Cross-Platform Rust Implementation

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want a REPL implementation that works consistently across Unix and Windows platforms, so that I can build cross-platform applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Unix systems THEN the system SHALL use the UnixVtConsoleInput and UnixVtConsoleOutput implementations
2. WHEN running on Windows systems THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate Windows console implementation
3. WHEN the REPL encounters platform-specific errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN the REPL is interrupted THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and restore terminal state
5. WHEN the REPL is used in different terminal emulators THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior
6. WHEN the application exits unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL ensure terminal state is restored

### Requirement 5: Go Binding Integration

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want to use the REPL functionality through Go bindings that provide idiomatic Go interfaces, so that I can integrate it into Go applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Go bindings THEN the system SHALL provide Go-native interfaces for REPL configuration
2. WHEN the Go REPL starts THEN the system SHALL properly initialize the WASM runtime and Rust components
3. WHEN Go callbacks are invoked THEN the system SHALL handle the transition between Go and Rust/WASM contexts safely
4. WHEN errors occur in the WASM layer THEN the system SHALL propagate them as Go errors with clear messages
5. WHEN the Go application exits THEN the system SHALL properly clean up WASM resources and restore terminal state
6. WHEN using Go channels for event handling THEN the system SHALL ensure thread-safe communication

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the REPL behavior including prompt text, key bindings, and callback functions, so that I can customize it for my specific application needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a REPL instance THEN the system SHALL accept a configurable prompt prefix string
2. WHEN setting up the REPL THEN the system SHALL accept a callback function for handling completed input
3. WHEN configuring key bindings THEN the system SHALL allow custom key combinations to be mapped to actions
4. WHEN setting REPL options THEN the system SHALL validate configuration parameters and return clear errors
5. WHEN the REPL is running THEN the system SHALL allow runtime updates to certain configuration options
6. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling that allows the REPL to recover from errors and continue operating, so that my application remains stable and user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console I/O errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and continue operation when possible
2. WHEN terminal state becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore it to a known good state
3. WHEN user callbacks throw exceptions THEN the system SHALL catch them and continue REPL operation
4. WHEN memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN the terminal is disconnected THEN the system SHALL detect this and exit cleanly
6. WHEN unrecoverable errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages before exiting

### Requirement 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the REPL to respond quickly to my input and efficiently update the display, so that I have a smooth interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types rapidly THEN the system SHALL keep up with input without dropping characters
2. WHEN updating the display THEN the system SHALL minimize the number of terminal control sequences sent
3. WHEN processing key events THEN the system SHALL handle them with minimal latency
4. WHEN the input buffer is large THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive cursor movement and editing
5. WHEN running for extended periods THEN the system SHALL not exhibit memory leaks or performance degradation
6. WHEN handling Unicode text THEN the system SHALL maintain performance comparable to ASCII text

### Requirement 9: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests that validate REPL functionality across different scenarios, so that I can be confident in the reliability of the implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL test individual REPL components in isolation
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test the complete REPL workflow with mock I/O
3. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling and recovery
4. WHEN testing cross-platform behavior THEN the system SHALL validate consistent functionality across platforms
5. WHEN testing with different terminal configurations THEN the system SHALL handle various terminal capabilities
6. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL meet defined latency and throughput requirements
