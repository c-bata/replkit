# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The console-input-output system provides cross-platform terminal input/output abstractions that enable robust, low-latency interaction with terminal environments. This system serves as the foundational layer for building interactive terminal applications, handling platform-specific differences in terminal control, raw mode management, and event delivery.

The system must support multiple platforms (Unix/Linux, Windows VT, Windows Legacy) while providing a unified interface. It also needs to accommodate different deployment scenarios including native applications and WASM-based environments where direct terminal access may be limited or require different approaches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Platform Terminal Input Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer building terminal applications, I want a unified interface for reading terminal input across different platforms, so that I can write platform-agnostic code while still accessing platform-specific optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ConsoleInput trait is implemented THEN it SHALL provide identical interfaces across Unix, Windows VT, and Windows Legacy platforms
2. WHEN raw input is requested THEN the system SHALL configure the terminal for non-canonical, non-echoing input mode
3. WHEN the application terminates THEN the terminal SHALL be automatically restored to its original state
4. WHEN key events are received THEN they SHALL be delivered as standardized KeyEvent structures
5. WHEN platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation with clear error reporting
6. WHEN multiple ConsoleInput instances are created THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's terminal state

### Requirement 2: Safe Raw Mode Management

**User Story:** As a developer using terminal raw mode, I want automatic restoration of terminal settings when my application exits or crashes, so that users don't get stuck with broken terminal behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw mode is enabled THEN a RAII guard SHALL be returned that automatically restores terminal state on drop
2. WHEN the application panics THEN the terminal SHALL be restored to its original state
3. WHEN multiple raw mode guards exist THEN they SHALL be properly nested and restored in reverse order
4. WHEN raw mode setup fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear error without partially modifying terminal state
5. WHEN the terminal is already in raw mode THEN subsequent raw mode requests SHALL either succeed or provide clear conflict resolution
6. WHEN raw mode is disabled THEN all terminal settings SHALL be restored exactly to their pre-raw state

### Requirement 3: Non-Blocking Event-Driven Input Processing

**User Story:** As a developer building responsive applications, I want non-blocking input processing with event callbacks, so that my application can handle user input without blocking the main thread or busy-waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the event loop is started THEN it SHALL run on a dedicated background thread
2. WHEN input is available THEN key event callbacks SHALL be invoked promptly without blocking
3. WHEN no input is available THEN the system SHALL wait efficiently using kernel primitives (poll/select/WaitForMultipleObjects)
4. WHEN the event loop is stopped THEN the background thread SHALL terminate cleanly within a reasonable timeout
5. WHEN callbacks are registered THEN they SHALL be invoked in a thread-safe manner
6. WHEN callback execution fails THEN the error SHALL be contained and the event loop SHALL continue running

### Requirement 4: Window Size Detection and Resize Notifications

**User Story:** As a developer creating terminal UIs, I want to detect the current terminal size and receive notifications when it changes, so that I can adapt my interface layout dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN window size is queried THEN the system SHALL return current terminal dimensions in columns and rows
2. WHEN the terminal window is resized THEN registered callbacks SHALL be invoked with new dimensions
3. WHEN resize events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce notifications to prevent callback flooding
4. WHEN the terminal size cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL return a reasonable default or clear error
5. WHEN resize callbacks are registered THEN they SHALL be invoked on the same thread as key event callbacks
6. WHEN the initial size is needed THEN the system SHALL optionally emit an initial resize event on startup

### Requirement 5: Unified Key Event Delivery

**User Story:** As a developer processing keyboard input, I want consistent key event representation across all platforms, so that my key handling logic works identically regardless of the underlying terminal implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN keys are pressed THEN they SHALL be converted to standardized KeyEvent structures using existing Key enum values
2. WHEN special key combinations are used THEN they SHALL be mapped consistently across platforms (Ctrl+C, arrows, function keys)
3. WHEN Unicode text is entered THEN it SHALL be properly decoded and delivered with correct character information
4. WHEN platform-specific key sequences are received THEN they SHALL be mapped to the closest equivalent standard key
5. WHEN key parsing fails THEN the system SHALL either recover gracefully or provide diagnostic information
6. WHEN bracketed paste mode is supported THEN paste events SHALL be delivered as structured data

### Requirement 6: Platform-Specific Implementation Strategy

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want each platform to have optimized implementations that leverage platform-specific capabilities while maintaining interface compatibility, so that performance and functionality are maximized on each target platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Unix/Linux THEN the system SHALL use termios and POSIX APIs for optimal performance
2. WHEN running on Windows with VT support THEN the system SHALL use VT sequences for maximum compatibility
3. WHEN running on legacy Windows THEN the system SHALL use Win32 console APIs with appropriate key mapping
4. WHEN platform detection occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically select the most appropriate backend
5. WHEN platform-specific features are used THEN they SHALL be abstracted behind the common interface
6. WHEN a platform lacks certain features THEN clear documentation SHALL indicate limitations and workarounds

### Requirement 7: WASM and Constrained Environment Support

**User Story:** As a developer targeting WASM or other constrained environments, I want a compatible interface that works within the limitations of these platforms, so that I can reuse my terminal application logic even when direct terminal access is not available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in WASM THEN the system SHALL provide a compatible interface that can be bridged to host environment capabilities
2. WHEN terminal APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations that maintain interface compatibility
3. WHEN event callbacks are needed in WASM THEN the system SHALL use serialization-based communication with the host environment
4. WHEN raw mode is requested in WASM THEN the system SHALL delegate to host environment or provide appropriate simulation
5. WHEN window size is queried in WASM THEN the system SHALL obtain dimensions through host environment communication
6. WHEN WASM limitations prevent full functionality THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate what features are unavailable

### Requirement 8: Thread Safety and Concurrent Access

**User Story:** As a developer building multi-threaded applications, I want thread-safe access to console input functionality, so that I can safely use the console interface from multiple threads without data races or corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple threads access ConsoleInput THEN all operations SHALL be thread-safe
2. WHEN callbacks are invoked THEN they SHALL be protected from concurrent modification of callback storage
3. WHEN the event loop is running THEN start/stop operations SHALL be safely callable from any thread
4. WHEN raw mode guards are used THEN they SHALL be safe to pass between threads
5. WHEN window size is queried concurrently THEN all threads SHALL receive consistent results
6. WHEN callback panics occur THEN they SHALL not corrupt the internal state of the console input system

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Diagnostics

3. WHEN configuration conflicts occur THEN errors SHALL provide guidance on resolution
4. WHEN callback registration fails THEN the specific cause SHALL be reported
5. WHEN event loop startup fails THEN detailed information about the failure cause SHALL be provided
6. WHEN terminal state restoration fails THEN the error SHALL be logged but not prevent application shutdown

### Requirement 10: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer creating high-performance terminal applications, I want efficient resource usage and minimal latency in input processing, so that my applications remain responsive even under heavy input load.

#### Acceptance Criteria
