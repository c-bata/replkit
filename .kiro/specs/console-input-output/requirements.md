# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The console-input-output system provides cross-platform terminal input/output abstractions that enable robust, low-latency interaction with terminal environments. This system serves as the foundational layer for building interactive terminal applications, handling platform-specific differences in terminal control, raw mode management, and synchronous input processing.

The system has been redesigned to use **synchronous, non-blocking methods** instead of asynchronous event loops, making it simpler to implement and more compatible with constrained environments like WASM. The system must support multiple platforms (Unix/Linux, Windows, WASM) while providing a unified interface that prioritizes simplicity and cross-platform compatibility.

## Core Design Philosophy

- **Synchronous Simplicity**: Avoid complex async patterns in favor of clear, synchronous interfaces
- **Non-Blocking First**: Prioritize non-blocking operations due to WASM constraints
- **Clear Intent**: Separate APIs for different use cases to improve code readability
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support Unix/Linux, Windows, WASM with a unified API

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Platform Terminal Input Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer building terminal applications, I want a unified synchronous interface for reading terminal input across different platforms, so that I can write platform-agnostic code while accessing platform-specific optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ConsoleInput trait is implemented THEN it SHALL provide identical synchronous interfaces across Unix, Windows, and WASM platforms
2. WHEN raw input is requested THEN the system SHALL configure the terminal for non-canonical, non-echoing input mode
3. WHEN the application terminates THEN the terminal SHALL be automatically restored to its original state
4. WHEN key events are received THEN they SHALL be delivered as standardized KeyEvent structures
5. WHEN platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation with clear error reporting
6. WHEN multiple ConsoleInput instances are created THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's terminal state

### Requirement 2: Safe Raw Mode Management with RAII

**User Story:** As a developer using terminal raw mode, I want automatic restoration of terminal settings when my application exits or crashes, so that users don't get stuck with broken terminal behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw mode is enabled THEN a RAII guard SHALL be returned that automatically restores terminal state on drop
2. WHEN the application panics THEN the terminal SHALL be restored to its original state
3. WHEN multiple raw mode guards exist THEN they SHALL be properly nested and restored in reverse order
4. WHEN raw mode setup fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear error without partially modifying terminal state
5. WHEN the terminal is already in raw mode THEN subsequent raw mode requests SHALL succeed safely
6. WHEN raw mode is disabled THEN all terminal settings SHALL be restored exactly to their pre-raw state

### Requirement 3: Synchronous Non-Blocking Input Processing

**User Story:** As a developer building responsive applications, I want synchronous non-blocking input methods with optional timeouts, so that my application can handle user input efficiently without complex async patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `try_read_key()` is called THEN it SHALL return immediately with available input or None
2. WHEN `read_key_timeout(Some(ms))` is called THEN it SHALL wait up to the specified timeout for input
3. WHEN `read_key_timeout(None)` is called THEN it SHALL block indefinitely until input is available (where supported)
4. WHEN no input is available THEN the system SHALL wait efficiently using kernel primitives (poll/select/WaitForMultipleObjects)
5. WHEN timeout expires THEN the method SHALL return None without error
6. WHEN input parsing fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error information

### Requirement 4: Window Size Detection

**User Story:** As a developer creating terminal UIs, I want to detect the current terminal size through polling, so that I can adapt my interface layout as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN window size is queried THEN the system SHALL return current terminal dimensions in columns and rows
2. WHEN the terminal size cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL return a reasonable default or clear error
3. WHEN window size polling is implemented THEN it SHALL be efficient and not cause excessive system calls
4. WHEN multiple threads query window size THEN all threads SHALL receive consistent results
5. WHEN window size changes THEN applications can detect it by polling at appropriate intervals
6. WHEN resize detection is critical THEN platform-specific signal handling can be implemented at the application level

### Requirement 5: Unified Key Event Delivery

**User Story:** As a developer processing keyboard input, I want consistent key event representation across all platforms, so that my key handling logic works identically regardless of the underlying terminal implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN keys are pressed THEN they SHALL be converted to standardized KeyEvent structures using existing Key enum values
2. WHEN special key combinations are used THEN they SHALL be mapped consistently across platforms (Ctrl+C, arrows, function keys)
3. WHEN Unicode text is entered THEN it SHALL be properly decoded and delivered with correct character information
4. WHEN platform-specific key sequences are received THEN they SHALL be mapped to the closest equivalent standard key
5. WHEN key parsing fails THEN the system SHALL either recover gracefully or provide diagnostic information
6. WHEN escape sequences are received THEN they SHALL be parsed correctly with appropriate timeouts

### Requirement 6: Platform-Specific Implementation Strategy

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want each platform to have optimized implementations that leverage platform-specific capabilities while maintaining interface compatibility, so that performance and functionality are maximized on each target platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Unix/Linux THEN the system SHALL use termios, poll(), and select() for optimal performance
2. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Console APIs (PeekConsoleInput, WaitForSingleObject)
3. WHEN platform detection occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically select the most appropriate backend
4. WHEN platform-specific features are used THEN they SHALL be abstracted behind the common interface
5. WHEN a platform lacks certain features THEN clear documentation SHALL indicate limitations and workarounds
6. WHEN timeout functionality is unavailable THEN the platform SHALL return appropriate UnsupportedFeature errors

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer debugging terminal applications, I want comprehensive error reporting and diagnostic information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve platform-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terminal operations fail THEN errors SHALL include platform-specific diagnostic information
2. WHEN unsupported features are accessed THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate what is not available and why
3. WHEN configuration conflicts occur THEN errors SHALL provide guidance on resolution
4. WHEN timeout operations fail THEN the specific cause SHALL be reported (e.g., UnsupportedFeature on WASM)
5. WHEN terminal setup fails THEN detailed information about the failure cause SHALL be provided
6. WHEN terminal state restoration fails THEN the error SHALL be logged but not prevent application shutdown

### Requirement 8: Multi-Language Binding Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer using Go or Python, I want access to console input functionality through idiomatic language bindings, so that I can integrate terminal capabilities into applications written in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Go bindings THEN console input SHALL be accessible through channel-based interfaces
2. WHEN using Python bindings THEN console input SHALL be accessible through synchronous Pythonic APIs
3. WHEN Go bindings are used THEN they SHALL provide `TryReadKey()`, `ReadKeyWithTimeout()`, and channel-based patterns
4. WHEN Python bindings are used THEN they SHALL expose `try_read_key()` and `read_key_timeout()` methods directly
5. WHEN errors occur in bindings THEN they SHALL be converted to appropriate language-specific error types
6. WHEN WASM is used for output in Go bindings THEN it SHALL use efficient JSON-based command protocols


## Success Criteria Summary

The console-input-output system is considered successful when:

1. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: All platforms provide the same synchronous API with clear documentation of limitations
2. **WASM Compatibility**: The system works in WASM environments with appropriate feature limitations  
3. **Reliability**: Terminal state is always properly restored, even on application crashes
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive mock infrastructure enables testing without real terminals
5. **Language Bindings**: Go and Python developers can use idiomatic interfaces that match their language conventions

## Migration from Previous Design

Applications migrating from the previous async/callback-based design should:

1. Replace callback registration with polling loops using `try_read_key()` or `read_key_timeout()`
2. Replace event loop management with application-controlled input loops
3. Replace resize callbacks with periodic window size polling or platform-specific signal handling
4. Update error handling for new `ConsoleError` types including `UnsupportedFeature`
