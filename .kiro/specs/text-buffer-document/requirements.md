# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the text buffer and document management system for the go-prompt port. This system provides the foundational text manipulation and cursor management capabilities required for interactive terminal applications. The Document structure represents immutable text with cursor position, while the Buffer structure provides mutable editing operations on top of Document instances.

## Dependencies

- Requires: key-input-parser (completed)
- Provides: Text buffer management for basic-line-editor and rendering-system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Structure Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Document structure that represents text content with cursor position, so that I can perform text analysis and cursor calculations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new Document THEN the system SHALL initialize with empty text and cursor position at 0
2. WHEN accessing text content THEN the system SHALL provide the complete text as a string
3. WHEN querying cursor position THEN the system SHALL return the position as a rune index (not byte index)
4. WHEN calculating display cursor position THEN the system SHALL account for double-width Unicode characters (CJK characters)
5. WHEN retrieving text before cursor THEN the system SHALL return substring from start to cursor position
6. WHEN retrieving text after cursor THEN the system SHALL return substring from cursor position to end
7. WHEN the Document contains multi-byte Unicode characters THEN all operations SHALL work correctly with rune-based indexing

### Requirement 2: Text Analysis and Navigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Document to provide text analysis methods, so that I can implement word-based navigation and text manipulation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN finding word boundaries THEN the system SHALL identify start and end positions of words relative to cursor
2. WHEN searching for previous word start THEN the system SHALL return relative position from cursor to word beginning
3. WHEN searching for next word end THEN the system SHALL return relative position from cursor to word ending
4. WHEN handling custom separators THEN the system SHALL support configurable word boundary characters
5. WHEN processing whitespace THEN the system SHALL provide options to include or exclude contiguous spaces
6. WHEN text contains only whitespace THEN word finding methods SHALL return appropriate boundary positions

### Requirement 3: Multi-line Text Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Document to handle multi-line text efficiently, so that I can build editors that support complex text input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains newlines THEN the system SHALL correctly split into individual lines
2. WHEN calculating line count THEN the system SHALL count lines including trailing newline as new line start
3. WHEN determining cursor row/column THEN the system SHALL provide 0-based coordinates
4. WHEN translating between index and position THEN the system SHALL convert accurately between linear index and (row, col) coordinates
5. WHEN moving cursor vertically THEN the system SHALL calculate relative positions for up/down movement
6. WHEN on last line THEN the system SHALL correctly identify this state for navigation logic

### Requirement 4: Buffer Management System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Buffer structure that manages mutable text editing operations, so that I can implement interactive text editing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new Buffer THEN the system SHALL initialize with empty working line and cursor at position 0
2. WHEN inserting text THEN the system SHALL support both insert and overwrite modes
3. WHEN inserting text THEN the system SHALL optionally move cursor after insertion
4. WHEN deleting text before cursor THEN the system SHALL remove specified character count and return deleted text
5. WHEN deleting text after cursor THEN the system SHALL remove specified character count and return deleted text
6. WHEN setting cursor position THEN the system SHALL validate position is within text bounds

### Requirement 5: Advanced Editing Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Buffer to provide advanced text editing operations, so that I can implement sophisticated editing features like line joining and character swapping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new line THEN the system SHALL support copying indentation from current line
2. WHEN joining lines THEN the system SHALL merge current line with next line using specified separator
3. WHEN swapping characters THEN the system SHALL exchange the two characters before cursor
4. WHEN moving cursor horizontally THEN the system SHALL respect line boundaries
5. WHEN moving cursor vertically THEN the system SHALL remember preferred column for consistent navigation
6. WHEN text is modified THEN the system SHALL invalidate cached Document instances

### Requirement 6: Unicode and Internationalization Support

**User Story:** As an international user, I want the system to handle Unicode text correctly, so that I can use the editor with any language including CJK characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Unicode text THEN the system SHALL use rune-based indexing throughout
2. WHEN calculating display width THEN the system SHALL account for character width variations (half-width, full-width)
3. WHEN handling combining characters THEN the system SHALL treat them as part of base character
4. WHEN working with right-to-left text THEN the system SHALL maintain logical cursor positioning
5. WHEN text contains emoji or other complex Unicode THEN all operations SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 7: Performance and Memory Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the text buffer system to be performant, so that it can handle large documents without lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching Document instances THEN the system SHALL reuse cached instances when text and cursor position unchanged
2. WHEN calculating line indexes THEN the system SHALL cache results for repeated access
3. WHEN performing text operations THEN the system SHALL minimize string allocations
4. WHEN handling large documents THEN operations SHALL complete in reasonable time
5. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL not leak memory through retained references

### Requirement 8: WASM Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer using Go bindings, I want the text buffer system to work through WASM, so that I can use it in Go applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling to WASM THEN the system SHALL not use any WASM-incompatible dependencies
2. WHEN marshaling data to/from WASM THEN the system SHALL handle Unicode text correctly
3. WHEN managing memory across WASM boundary THEN the system SHALL not cause memory leaks
4. WHEN handling large text buffers THEN WASM memory limits SHALL be respected
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL propagate errors properly across WASM boundary

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling, so that invalid operations don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cursor position is out of bounds THEN the system SHALL clamp to valid range
2. WHEN negative counts are provided THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully or return appropriate errors
3. WHEN text operations would create invalid state THEN the system SHALL prevent or correct the state
4. WHEN memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without corruption
5. WHEN invalid Unicode sequences are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle without panicking
